# RedM Auto Panning

Hate having to press the enter button every so often while panning for gold in RedM?

No problem! This simple Java program will let you afk pan gold until you can't anymore.
## Features

- Easy to use UI
- Timings for each action shown
- Randomized timings
- - Wait time and panning time.

## Installation

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/DRAGEno01/RedM-Auto-Panning/releases) and install the latest version of the installer. It should be a .bat file. You will then need to select the Python install by pressing 0 when prompting which language version.

Once you have done that, make sure Python is installed (WITH IT BEING ADDED TO THE PATH), and then head over to your Desktop (you may need to view it in C://Users/YOUR_USER_ID/Desktop) and open the nessasary folders until you find "Python" folder. In that folder there is a .bat file to start it all up. Then you are ready to go and pan away in RedM.

## FAQ

#### How do I use this project?

You can click the start and stop button on the project, or if you prefer, you can use the F6 key to start and F7 stop the project.

#### Can I change the keybinds?

You can change the start and stop keybinds in settings, and it will save between uses!

#### Does this bypass anti-cheat?

It does not attempt to bypass. There may be code for randomized timings, but no other active attempts. This will NEVER try to insert or inject scripts into the game. This script just mymics the keyboard.

#### Does this inject into RedM?

No, this just simulates the space button and checks if there is a program running that matches the name of the RedM/RDR2 program. If you really wanted to, you could use this to write a book with (not practical, but point still stands) this project. The "detection" of the game is not a required part of the program.

(As of the Python release, the Python version does not activly check if there is a program called RedM open).

#### What if I get banned?

We are no responsible for any action taken against you for using this auto panning script.
