# RedM Auto Panning

Hate having to press the enter button every so often while panning for gold in RedM?

No problem! This simple Java program will let you afk pan gold until you can't anymore.
## Features

- Easy to use UI
- Timings for each action shown
- Randomized timings
- - Wait time and panning time.

## Installation

Install the Setup.bat file from releases to install the latest version. You will need to install the setup file if you are downloading from V1.103 and onwards.

From there double click the Setup.bat file and check your Desktop folder for a new folder called "RedM Auto Panner". Inside that folder is another bat file that you can just double click and run the application.

### Alternate Installation Method

Run this in command prompt or powershell.
```bash
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DRAGEno01/RedM-Auto-Panning/main/install.sh | bash
```
    

This requires you to have Java installed.

## FAQ

#### Does this bypass anti-cheat?

It does not attempt to bypass. There may be code for randomized timings, but no other active attempts.

#### Does this inject into RedM?

No, this just simulates the space button. If you really wanted to, you could use this to write a book with (not practical, but point still stands) this project.

#### What if I get banned?

We are no responsible for any action taken against you for using this auto panning script.
